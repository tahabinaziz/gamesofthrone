              A Game of Thrones takes place over the course of one year on or
              near the fictional continent of Westeros. The story begins when
              King Robert visits the northern castle Winterfell to ask Ned Stark
              to be his right-hand assistant, or Hand of the King. The previous
              Hand, Jon Arryn, died under suspicious circumstances. Robert comes
              with his queen, Cersei Lannister, and his retinue, which includes
              a number of Lannisters. Just after the royal party arrives, Nedâ€™s
              wife, Catelyn, receives a message claiming that the Lannister
              family was responsible for the death of the former Hand. She tells
              Ned, who accepts the position as Hand in order to protect Robert
              from the Lannisters.
